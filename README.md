# paired_end_sorter
## What is it about?
Sometimes, when you do genomic assembly, you don't have clean data, especially with paired-end reads coming from 
Illumina technology. This script is used to re-assemble pairs of reads, coming from 2 differents files, not sorted, and 
with uncomplete pairs trapped in it. (readX.1 without a readX.2, etc...)

## Version
Version 1.0
Time to treat 2 files with 659,996 and 593,837 reads: 1h 21min 40sec

## Installation
You will need biopython:

        sudo pip3 install biopython

## Documentation
        ./paired_end_sorter.py <reads1> <reads2> -o <output_file> [options]

Please fork and propose pull requests as much as you want.
I will be happy to optimize my script and help as much as I can.
