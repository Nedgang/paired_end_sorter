# paired_end_sorter
## What is it about?
Sometimes, when you do genomic assembly, you don't have clean data, especially with paired-end reads coming from 
Illumina technology. This script is used to re-assemble pairs of reads, coming from 2 differents files, not sorted, and 
with uncomplete pairs trapped in it. (readX.1 without a readX.2, etc...)
At the end, you will have a file with entrelaced pairs on paired-end reads.

## Version
